# Suvam's Color Change Portfolio Website ðŸŒ—

This is a portfolio website that showcases the works of **Kate Amelia** (a fictional character) in **Web Development** and **UI Design**. The website allows users to switch between **Dark Mode** and **Light Mode** using a toggle button. The portfolio also includes various hover effects and a responsive design to ensure compatibility across devices.

## ðŸš€ Features

### 1. **Dark Mode/Light Mode Toggle**

- A toggle button is provided to switch between Dark and Light themes.
- The theme is saved in `localStorage` so it persists even after the page is refreshed or revisited.
- The icon changes between a **moon** (for light mode) and a **sun** (for dark mode).

### 2. **Responsive Design**

- The website is fully responsive and works smoothly across various screen sizes, including mobile devices.
- The **main image** appears on the right-hand side of the screen in the middle and is responsive to the viewport.

### 3. **Hover Effects on Images**

- The **back image** and **main image** have a hover effect that adds an interactive and engaging experience to the website.
- When hovering over the images, the **back image** moves up slightly, and the **main image** centers itself.

### 4. **Social Media Icons**

- Linked social media icons (LinkedIn, Behance, Dribbble) are present with hover effects, allowing visitors to easily access the creator's social profiles.

### 5. **Custom Navigation Bar**

- A simple yet clean navigation bar is provided with links to different sections like Home, About, Portfolio, Services, and Hire Me.
- These links have a hover color effect that enhances the user interaction experience.

### 6. **Customizable Content**

- The project is easy to customize with your own content, images, and links. Just replace the placeholder content like text and images in the `index.html` and `style.css` files.
